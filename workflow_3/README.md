# Workflow 3: CDG

## Goal
Find drug targets for Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) and the implicated glycosylation machinery involved in their pathology.

## Motivation
Create a simple and highly adaptable workflow to target the glycosylation enzymes implicated in the pathology of CDGs.

## Schematic of Workflow 3

### Description of steps:
1. Input gene list representative of all known CDGs.
2. Enrichr analysis to see scored phenotypes and enriched glycans.
3. AutoRif analysis to elucidate drugs specific to the phenotype of interest (CDG).
4. Assess scored glycans, select glycan of interest, extract glycosylation enzyme data for that glycan.
5. Input gene name for a glycosylation enzyme of interest.
6. Use AutoRif to identify drug targets for that particular enzyme.

*This workflow aims to streamline the process of identifying drug targets for CDGs by leveraging existing databases and analysis tools to pinpoint glycosylation enzymes and potential therapeutic interventions.*
