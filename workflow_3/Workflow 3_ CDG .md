**Workflow 3: CDG**

**Goal:** Find drug targets for Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) and the implicated glycosylation machinery involved in their pathology.


**Motivation:** Create a simple and highly adaptable workflow to target the glycosylation enzymes implicated in the pathology of CDGs.

**Description of Steps:**

1) Input gene list representative of all known CDGs
1) Enrichr analysis to see scored phenotypes and enriched glycans. 
1) AutoRif analysis to elucidate drugs specific to the phenotype of interest (CDG).
1) Assess scored glycans, select glycan of interest, extract glycosylation enzyme data for that glycan.
1) Input gene name for a glycosylation enzyme of interest.
1) Use AutoRif to identify drug targets for that particular enzyme. 

**Input:** Gene list which encodes all known congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG).

**Output:** Drug targets for the phenotype CDG as well as for the implicated glycosylation enzyme machinery.

**Shortcomings:** These were addressed via the Github ticket reporting system for all projects. This particular workflow had no shortcomings.
