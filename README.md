Project 1 – Develop workflows for playbook based on CFDE data

**Matthew Marino**

**Specific Project:** Create workflows using Workflow Playbook metanodes and other DCC’s data.

**Description:** The aim of the project is to create meaningful workflows using the CFDE Workflow Playbook (WP)metanodes/endpoints. The workflow should be based on a use case or should be able to answer a specific question using data in Workflow Playbook (WP). To create the workflow, existing data in the workflow playbook can be used or individual’s research data can be also used. The successful workflow will be documented and shared with the WP team. Any missing component, suggestion to add metanodes, features will also be documented and shared with the WP team. GlyGen or glycosylation related data can also be used to create the workflow. The process will also enable the identification of components that can be added to GlyGen from other resources. Any interesting ideas can be explored also using other DCCs data not in WP or partially in WP.

**Motivation:**  Using other DCC’s data to create a workflow will enable to connect data from different data domains and answer specific questions that were difficult and time-consuming to answer and required access to multiple resources. It will help adding or expanding information in GlyGen and connect to other DCC’s data. Part of this project is also the continued identification of missing data and data processing steps in the playbook and the documentation of specifications (inputs, outputs, function, benefits). This will also include finding data present in GlyGen that is currently not provided to the playbook but would be useful for certain workflows.

**Workflows that were created: June 3rd - July 26th 2024**

1) **Workflow 1: RNA Seq Centric** 
1) **Workflow 2: Drug targets for Biomarker related data**
1) **Workflow 3: Drug targets for congenital disorders of glycosylation**

**Outcome:** The documented workflow will be added to GitHub and GlyGen Wiki with readme. Create tickets in Github for any missing components.

**Shortcomings:** All tickets were submitted to Github.
